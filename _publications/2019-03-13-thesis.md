collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2019-03-13-thesis
excerpt: 'The thesis explores the relationship between frugivore behavior and plant spatial genetics. The work assesses i) the literature on frugivore behavior and resulting spatial genetic structure, finding  the patterns between animal movement and plant population genetics resulting on this [review](https://tgelmi-candusso.github.io/publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3). ii) the methodology behind the estimation of seed dispersal distance comparing observational, molecular and modeling methods, resulting on this [paper](https://tgelmi-candusso.github.io/publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2). iii) the relationship between primate foraging behavior, plant phenology and population genetics iv) the effect of frugivore territoriality on plant population genetics; v) the development of microsatellite markers for neotropical trees and validates the use of FTA cards as a method for sampling plant DNA material in the Neotropics.'
