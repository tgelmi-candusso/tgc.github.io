excerpt: 'Loss of interspecific interactions often precedes extinction events, making it important to inform conservation strategies. However, collecting data on species interactions can be challenging and costly. Hence, alternative data collection methods are needed, and camera traps potentially present a cost-effective way to identify food web links and generate trophic networks. We compared two types of datasets derived from camera traps, and test their effectiveness to build bipartite predator-prey networks. Our findings suggest the two datasets provided complementary information on the bipartite networks’ structure: the predation events dataset underestimated large mammal prey, and the potential encounter events underestimated small mammal prey. Together, the predator-prey links we found reflected previous literature on dietary analysis. To improve the information provided by camera traps on trophic interactions, we suggest taking into account site-specific conditions (e.g., presence of bird-feeders or microhabitat differences), as these may alter both predation events and potential encounter events captured. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the predator-prey links obtained with potential encounter events, time interval threshold and capture sequence (i.e., prey or predator captured first) should be taken into account in the definition of a potential encounter event. Overall, we recommend using camera traps as a cost-effective, valuable tool for identifying predator-prey interaction links across scales.'

'Loss of interspecific interactions often precedes extinction events. Therefore, knowledge on species interactions is important to inform conservation strategies aiming at maintaining biodiversity in a changing world. Collecting data on species interactions can, however, be challenging and costly. Hence, alternative data collection methods are needed, and camera traps potentially present a cost-effective way to identify food web links and generate trophic networks. Here, we compare two types of datasets, derived from camera traps, and test their effectiveness to build bipartite predator-prey networks: one based on predation events (prey observed within predator’s jaws), and one based on potential encounter events (i.e., predator and prey species captured within a defined time threshold). Our analyses focused on two predators: coyotes (Canis latrans) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in an urbanized area (Toronto, Canada). Our findings suggest the two datasets provided complementary information on the bipartite networks’ structure: the predation events dataset underestimated large mammal prey, and the potential encounter events underestimated small mammal prey. Together, the predator-prey links we found reflected previous literature on dietary analysis. To improve the information provided by camera traps on trophic interactions, we suggest taking into account site-specific conditions (e.g., presence of bird-feeders or microhabitat differences), as these may alter both predation events and potential encounter events captured. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the predator-prey links obtained with potential encounter events, time interval threshold and capture sequence (i.e., prey or predator captured first) should be taken into account in the definition of a potential encounter event. Overall, we recommend using camera traps as a cost-effective, valuable tool for identifying predator-prey interaction links across scales.'
