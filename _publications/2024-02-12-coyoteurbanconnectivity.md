excerpt: 'We assessed landscape connectivity for coyotes dynamically across temporal scales and demographic traits. We found that: (1) high-vegetation density areas were key for connectivity in urban areas, (2) riverbanks, railways, and areas below power lines were predicted as movement corridors, and (3) commercial and industrial clusters strongly disrupted connectivity. Spatio-temporal differences in connectivity were detected following time of day and coyote social status but not following climate and biological seasonality nor coyote age/sex.'

Protecting wildlife movement corridors is critical for species conservation. Urban planning often aims to create corridors for animal movement through conservation initiatives. However, research on connectivity for urban wildlife is limited. Here, we assessed connectivity for coyotes (Canis latrans) dynamically across temporal scales and demographic traits, parametrized using the habitat selection of 27 global positioning system (GPS)-collared coyotes in the city of Toronto, Canada. The habitat selection models accounted for human population density, impervious area, vegetation density, and distance to different linear features. Results indicated that (1) vegetation-dense areas were key for connectivity in urban areas; (2) riverbanks, railways, and areas below power lines were predicted as movement corridors; and (3) commercial and industrial clusters strongly disrupted connectivity. Spatiotemporal differences in connectivity were associated with time of day and coyote social status but not with climate and biological seasonality or coyote age and sex. Residential roads were pivotal in the temporal dynamism of connectivity. The maintenance and enhancement of plant structural complexity along key infrastructure (for example, highways, waterways, and parking lots) should be considered when managing connectivity corridors in cities.
