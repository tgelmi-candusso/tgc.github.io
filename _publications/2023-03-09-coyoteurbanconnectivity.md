excerpt: 'Spatial genetic structure (SGS) of plants results from the nonrandom distribution of related individuals. SGS provides information on gene flow and spatial patterns of genetic diversity within populations. We compared the proportions of studies with SGS among groups and tested for differences in strength of SGS using Sp statistics. The presence of SGS differed among taxonomic groups, with reduced presence in plants dispersed by birds. Strength of SGS was instead significantly influenced by the behaviour of seed dispersal vectors, with higher SGS in plant species dispersed by animals with behavioural traits that result in short seed dispersal distances'

Protecting wildlife movement corridors is critical for species conservation. Urban planning often aims to create corridors for animal movement through conservation initiatives. However, research on connectivity for urban wildlife is limited. Here, we assessed connectivity for coyotes dynamically across temporal scales and demographic traits, based on the habitat selection of 27 GPS-collared coyotes in Toronto (Canada), while accounting for human population density, impervious area, vegetation index, and distance to different linear features. We found that: (1) high-vegetation density areas were key for connectivity in urban areas, (2) riverbanks, railways, and areas below power lines were predicted as movement corridors, and (3) commercial and industrial clusters strongly disrupted connectivity. Spatio-temporal differences in connectivity were detected following time of day and coyote social status but not following climate and biological seasonality nor coyote age/sex. Residential roads were pivotal in the temporal dynamism of connectivity. The maintenance and enhancement of dense and diverse vegetation should be considered when managing connectivity corridors in cities.
