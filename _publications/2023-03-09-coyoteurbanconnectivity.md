excerpt: 'We assessed landscape connectivity for coyotes dynamically across temporal scales and demographic traits. We found that: (1) high-vegetation density areas were key for connectivity in urban areas, (2) riverbanks, railways, and areas below power lines were predicted as movement corridors, and (3) commercial and industrial clusters strongly disrupted connectivity. Spatio-temporal differences in connectivity were detected following time of day and coyote social status but not following climate and biological seasonality nor coyote age/sex.'
