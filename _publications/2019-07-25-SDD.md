title: "Estimating seed dispersal distance: a comparison of methods using animal movement and plant genetic data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2019-07-25-SDD
excerpt: 'We investigated two plant species with different life history traits exclusively dispersed by two arboreal mammals, Saguinus mystax and Leontocebus nigrifrons. We compared seed dispersal distance obtained from direct observations, genetic identification of mother plants from seed coats, parentage analysis of seedlings/saplings, and phenomenological and mechanistic modeling approaches.'

'We investigated two plant species with different life history traits, Leonia cymosa and Parkia panurensis, exclusively dispersed by two tamarin species, Saguinus mystax and Leontocebus nigrifrons. We compared seed dispersal distance obtained from direct observations, genetic identification of mother plants from seed coats, parentage analysis of seedlings/saplings, and phenomenological and mechanistic modeling approaches.'
