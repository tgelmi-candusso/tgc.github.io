Tiziana Gelmi Candusso is a research fellow, hosted by the Fortin lab at the University of Toronto, as an awardee of the Walter Benjamin research fellowship funded by the German Research foundation.

Her work focuses on applying computational methods to understand the spatial ecology of urban mammals, in particular mesopredators. She is particularly interested on how urbanization impacts their community and their ecological contribution as predators and seed dispersers. 

As part of the analysis, using GPS tracking data collected by the Ontario Ministry, she has studied the habitat use of Coyotes in Toronto, the permeability of the city to their movement and how the city influences their movement patterns and the potential cascading effect into seed dispersal efficacy. Furthermore, she has collected 2 yrs of presence datapoints of urban wildlife at 54 sites in Toronto, with which she has analyzed the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on prey-predator communities, mesopredator interactions and deer occupancy. As part of the data management for the latter, she has trained an object classification AI model using a deep convolutional networks specifically for urban wildlife.

Previous to her immersion into urban wildlife, she developed her doctorate thesis at the German primate center, where she analyzed frugivore movement, the cascading effects on seed dispersal efficacy and its translation into plant population genetics. She developed an spatially-explicit individual-based model, assessed behavioral observations and analyzed the genetic components of plant populations using microsatellites. 

When she is not running models, and sometimes while the models are running, Tiziana is a mother to Leonardo, 7 and Emma, 4, who enjoy hiking the Ontario trails and identifying urban mammals from the camera trap dataset.
