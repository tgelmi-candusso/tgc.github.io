Tiziana Gelmi Candusso is a research fellow (PDF) hosted by the Fortin lab at the University of Toronto through a Walter Benjamin research award (German Research foundation) and now funded through the School of Cities at U of T.

Her work focuses on applying computational methods to understand the spatial ecology of urban mammals, i.e. landscape connectivity, habitat selection and movement behavior. She is particularly interested on how landscape impacts wildlife communities and their role in animal and plant-animal interactions.

Using GPS tracking data, she has analyzed the habitat use of Coyotes in Toronto, the landscape connectivity for this species in urban areas, and the cascading effect of changes in their movement into their seed dispersal ranges. Furthermore, she has collected 2 yrs of presence/absence datapoints of urban mammals at 54 sites in Toronto,to analyze prey-predator communities, mesopredator interactions and deer occupancy. As part of the data management for the latter, she has been trained at Caltech for the generation of computer vision models for species recognition.

Previously, during her doctorate at Heymann's lab in GÃ¶ttingen-Germany, she analyzed frugivore movement, its cascading effects on seed dispersal and its translation into plant population genetics. She developed a spatially-explicit individual-based model, assessed behavioral observations and analyzed the genetic components of plant populations using microsatellites.
