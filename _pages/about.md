Tiziana Gelmi Candusso is a research fellow (PDF) hosted by the Fortin lab at the University of Toronto through a Walter Benjamin research award (German Research foundation) and now funded through the School of Cities at U of T.

Her work focuses on applying computational methods to understand the spatial ecology of urban mammals, i.e. landscape connectivity, habitat selection, and machine learning models. She is particularly interested on how landscape impacts wildlife communities and their role in animal and plant-animal interactions.
